# About

This is an in-development, upcoming extension for the Google Chrome web browser. In it you will be able to do the following:

- See your recently closed tabs.
- Access your tab browsing history.
- Browse through the tabs on all of your synced Google Chrome sessions on all of your devices.
- Bring similar tabs into a single tab with the ability to restore when needed.
- Snooze specific tabs to be woken up at later times or dates.


# Future

Additions are being made every day until I feel that it can be launched.
